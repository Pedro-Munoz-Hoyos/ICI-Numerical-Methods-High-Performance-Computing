Related code from the course in Numerical Methods and High-Performance Computing attended during the M.Sc. in Computational Fluid Dynamics at Cranfield University. The numerical engines solve the one-dimensional linear advection equations using two different initial conditions, namely F_0 and F_1, to address the numerical dissipation and dispersion of five numerical schemes, namely the FTCS, First-order upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff, and Fifth-order WENO. The parallelization of the sequential code was performed using OpenMPI, and the simulation parameters, ranging from the domain extension to the Courant number of the simulation, are introduced via an "Input.dat" file.
